                It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
                Broken glass everywhere

                People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
                I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
                Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
                Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
                Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
                I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
                Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

                Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
                I'm trying not to lose my head
                It's like a jungle sometimes
                It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

                Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
                Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
                Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
                Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
                Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
                A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
                Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
                So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
                She went to the city and got so so seditty
                She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

                It's like a jungle sometimes
                It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

                My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
                Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
                All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
                Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
                The bill collectors, they ring my phone
                And scare my wife when I'm not home
                Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
                Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
                Neon King Kong standin' on my back
                Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
                A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
                Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
                I swear I might hijack a plane!

                It's like a jungle sometimes
                It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

                My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
                Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
                And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
                If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
                Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
                Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
                Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
                You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
                They pushed that girl in front of the train
                Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
                Stabbed that man right in his heart
                Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
                I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
                Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
                I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
                Hear them say "You want some more?"
                Livin' on a see-saw

                It's like a jungle sometimes
                It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

                A child is born with no state of mind
                Blind to the ways of mankind
                God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
                Because only God knows what you'll go through
                You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
                And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
                The places you play and where you stay
                Looks like one great big alleyway
                You'll admire all the number-book takers
                Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
                Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
                And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
                Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
                Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
                You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
                But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
                Now you're unemployed, all non-void
                Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
                Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
                Got sent up for a eight-year bid
                Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
                Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
                Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
                Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
                It was plain to see that your life was lost
                You was cold and your body swung back and forth
                But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
                Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

                It's like a jungle sometimes
                It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under.
