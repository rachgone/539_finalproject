            <p>Music in the 1980s was all about image and with the advent and popularity of MTV, the images that
                accompanied artists became more important than ever. When it came to music during the decade, nothing
                was understated, not the sound, not the fashion, not even the charity. The 1980s reflected the beginning
                of a period of great income disparity and a focus on affluence was reflected in the music. There were
                also several new genres that popped up including, Hip Hop, New Wave and Hair Metal, all of which have
                influenced music today.</p>
